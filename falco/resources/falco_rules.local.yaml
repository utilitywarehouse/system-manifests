# We have a ;lot of things that are talking to apiservers, for example this
# rule reports a lot of activity from Mongo orchestrators in dev environments.
# Instead of trying to police every request and whitelist, it should be safe to
# just allow all and rely on audit logs to trace access to apiservers.

- rule: Packet socket created in container
  desc: >
    Detect new packet socket at the device driver (OSI Layer 2) level in a container. Packet socket could be used for ARP Spoofing 
    and privilege escalation (CVE-2020-14386) by an attacker. Noise can be reduced by using the user_known_packet_socket_binaries
    template list.

# Rule: Interactive Executions in Containers
# is modified version of 'Terminal shell in container' default rule 
#
# WHAT IT DETECTS (proc.tty != 0):
#   Catches standard interactive sessions where a terminal (PTY) is allocated.
#   - kubectl exec -it my-pod -- sh  (and all commands run inside that shell)
#   - kubectl exec -it my-pod -- ls -la
#
# WHAT IT MISSES (Intentional Exclusion):
#   Non-interactive execs (e.g., `kubectl exec my-pod -- ls -la` without -it) are NOT captured.
#   
#   REASON:
#   At the kernel level, non-interactive execs are effectively indistinguishable from 
#   Kubernetes Liveness/Readiness probes. Enabling detection for these would flood logs with valid probe activity.
#   non-interactive execs can be monitored via Kubernetes API Audit Logs instead.

- rule: Interactive Executions in Containers
