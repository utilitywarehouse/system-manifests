# We have a ;lot of things that are talking to apiservers, for example this
# rule reports a lot of activity from Mongo orchestrators in dev environments.
# Instead of trying to police every request and whitelist, it should be safe to
# just allow all and rely on audit logs to trace access to apiservers.

# Patch "Packet socket created in container" rule to avoid catching metallb

- rule: Packet socket created in container
  desc: > 
    Detect new packet socket at the device driver (OSI Layer 2) level in a container. Packet socket could be used for ARP Spoofing 
    and privilege escalation (CVE-2020-14386) by an attacker. Noise can be reduced by using the user_known_packet_socket_binaries
    template list.
  condition: > 
    evt.type=socket and evt.dir=>
    and container 
    and evt.arg.domain contains AF_PACKET 
    and not proc.name in (user_known_packet_socket_binaries)
    and not k8s.ns.name in (sys-metallb)
