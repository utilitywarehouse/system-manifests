To update Trident manifests, update the version number inside Dockerfile. Then
run `make build gen-yaml`.

This will run tridentctl inside Docker and update our manifests

There are additional manifests to deploy certificates to be used by trident and
work in conjunction with `Reloader`, in order to be able to auto roll pods when
certificates are rotated.
A few notes regarding the above:
- Trident seems to need to mount both server and client side tls to all
  components, even though they are probably not used.
- Trident needs a flag to be set for the location of an aes encryption secret,
  which can point to an empty file if this is not used. This behaviour is not
  identified as an issue by trident: https://github.com/NetApp/trident/issues/519
