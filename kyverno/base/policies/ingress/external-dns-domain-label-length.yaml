      External-DNS uses TXT records to flag ownership of DNS records. For that
      purpose it uses the following domain label is used
      `<prefix>-<type>-<domain-label>`. There is an RFC limitation of 63 chars
      per DNS domain label which should be respected by the generated
      TXT records as well. Even though the 63 chars limit is for all labels,
      let's only check the one edited via external-DNS since the rest should be
      problematic regardless.
