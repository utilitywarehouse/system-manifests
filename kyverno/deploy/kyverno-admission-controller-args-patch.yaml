# Patches kyverno controllers deployment arguments.
#
# Since Kyverno controllers are now split into separate Deployments we need to
# specify the needed flags in the respective controller arguments based on:
# https://kyverno.io/docs/installation/customization/#container-flags
#
# The following flags are set:
#
# -v=0 lowers logging verbisity as Kyverno tends to get chatty during background
# operations and logs were dropper by the forwarders
#
# --admissionReports=false
# --backgroundScan=false
# If both backgroundScan and admissionReports are set to false the entire
# reports system will be disabled.
# https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v180-rc3
# We saw that the Kyverno reporting system, introduced with version v1.7, will
# produce thousands of admissionreports and backgroundscanreports objects, which
# can hammer etcd members and will definitely double the db size. Disabling will
# not stop Kyverno from doing periodic background policy checks and update the
# metric we rely on to be alerted on violations.
#
# --forceFailurePolicyIgnore=true will make sure we have a fail open policy everywhere.
